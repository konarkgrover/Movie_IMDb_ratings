# Barbie-Movie-IMDb-Review
This machine learning project aims to predict the IMDb rating sentiment of a single movie based on the sentiments provided in a dataset. The dataset consists of two columns: one for sentiments and the other for the movie's rating. The sentiments will be used as input features, while the ratings will serve as the target variable for training the model.

Rating Sentiment Interpretation

The ratings in the dataset will be interpreted as follows:

Ratings less or equal to 4 will be considered "Negative" reviews.

Ratings between 4 and 7 (inclusive) will be labelled as "Neutral" reviews.

Ratings greater than 7 will be classified as "Positive" reviews.
